msi - microsoft installer

python3 for linux

you have use underscore not camel casing here

intent here is spacing

dont use camel case here

look when you import something the thing in that file only gets imported 
the newly updated thing wont be available

solution
its like nodemon all the chages get updated
from importlib import reload
reload(filename)  you have to execute this line in order to get current code

in order to clear the terminal in python shell ctrl+L

if elif else


sudo apt install python3-requests
