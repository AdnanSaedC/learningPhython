immutable list

>>> tuple1=(1,2,3)
>>> tuple1[3]=4  you can't add value to the tuple
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> tuple2=(4,5)
>>> tuple3=tuple1+tuple2
>>> tuple3  this is the only way to add or expand tuple
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> 

tuple.count(value)


unwrapping tuples the only catch is the len of the tuple and the variable has to be same
>>> (val1,val2,val3)=tuple1
>>> val1
1
>>>
