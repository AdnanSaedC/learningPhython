look at 01_basic __pychache__

everything which has __ deals with python inner working


this is how thing works 
python scripy gets converted into byte code which runs on python virtual machine

byte code is low level language and machine independent

byte code runs faster because most of the checking of syntax and all 
already happend 

.pyc compiled python

here __pychache__ here is the compiled maybe byte code version of hello.pyc
the format is sourceCode.pythonCompiler(pythonVersion actual name)-version.extension
usually cpython there are other varinats we have jpython(for java binaries)

this work __pychache__ only for imported file(for optimiization)


python vertual machine
it isnothing but a loop which works continuosly and the thing it gets itexecutes that

that why python is an interpreted language

every language needs a runtime engine

byte code is not a machine code

what is byte code and frozen binaries(compiled version)


so the flow is script to byte code to pvm
and while importing from files byte code is explictly seen because it increases the effieciency if you are importing else where no need of byte code to be generated

here frozen binaries means they take the script and vm bundled together and you can run the entire script anywhere whithout python being installed

look when ever a new variable points to the memory space the ref_count get increases
if two variable poiting somewhere then ref_count = 2

the most important crazy detail in python is not a single variable holds the data types it is the memory allocation which has got the data types the variables are just poiting towards it
