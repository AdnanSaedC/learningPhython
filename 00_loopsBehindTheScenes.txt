iteration toools
like for,while,comprehension(squares_of_evens = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
)

we need iterable objects like list,file etc
look this is how loops work in python 
iterable tools works on iterable objects and then it returns iter which has first objectv location and next 

and when we call __next__ it gives next value address and consecutive value location for the last value an exception is raised

A for loop calls iter() on an iterable to get an iterator, then repeatedly calls __next__() to get the next value until StopIteration is raised.
