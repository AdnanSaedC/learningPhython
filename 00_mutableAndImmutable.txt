mutuble are the things which can be changed and the opposite of it is immutable

evrything is object in python

immutable means
lets say

name = "adnan"
in memory a separate place is assign and the value is "adnan"

and the name points towards that
mutable means you can make chages in the storage where adnan is stored

you can make adnan -> "adnannn"

in python for string thats not possible

where will assign another value to a variable a seprate spca eis created and the new value is assigned and  our variable noe points towards this new location

this is was created in the first place to save space

name -> "adnan"
name -> "adnannn"

if the space is not being pointed by any variable then garbage collector wipes out the space

the garbage collection for numbers and string happens little late because their creation takes time so python keeps that in space so that in near future we may need it    

a=5
a=a+2 behind the scene a=5+2 the variables gets replaced by the values

>>> mylistone=[1,2,3]
>>> mylisttwo=mylistone
>>> mylistone
[1, 2, 3]
>>> mylisttwo
[1, 2, 3]
>>> mylisttwo[0]=5
>>> mylisttwo
[5, 2, 3]
>>> mylistone
[5, 2, 3]  look i made changes in mylistone and its reflected in both the places
>>> mylistone=[5,2,3] but now iam creating a new refrence
>>> mylistone
[5, 2, 3]
>>> mylisttwo
[5, 2, 3]
>>> mylisttwo[1]=6 thats why now if i make changes its not being reflected
>>> mylisttwo
[5, 6, 3]
>>> mylistone
[5, 2, 3]


in order to create refrence
obj1= obj2[:] its called slicing and it will take all the value from start to end

import copy
>>> mylistthree = copy.deepcopy(mylistone) this will copy all the list inside the list

to check if both the values have the same memory refrence then var1 is var2
true means yes else no

>>> l=4
>>> m=l
>>> m is l
True

//this is to check if the values are same or not
>>> m==l
True
